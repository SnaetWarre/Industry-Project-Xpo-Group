ABOUT US About us Contact Press FAQ Register your visit participants Taal: EN EN NL FR DE This was FFD 2024 Discover the event This was FFD 2024 Successful third edition leaves visitors with taste for more Flanders Flooring Days attracts international visitors from 78 countries Yesterday the key players at Flanders Flooring Days shut the doors behind them with satisfaction at the end of a successful event. This third edition really put the trade fair for the European flooring industry on the international map. Participants welcomed no fewer than 4.245 visitors from 78 countries in their showrooms and at The Hub in Kortrijk. New for this year: The Hub, Trend Talks and a free shuttle service. Since 2022, producers of hard and soft flooring and related products have been coming together for the sector-wide trade show Flanders Flooring Days. It started with leading producers welcoming visitors to their showrooms and production facilities. More than ten well-known names from the sector took part, all within a radius of 25 kilometres. And the founding partners, Associated Weavers Europe, Balta, Beaulieu International Group, Belysse, Lano, Unilin Flooring and US Floors - Coretec, are still central to the fair today. An unmissable event Flanders Flooring Days remains a platform for the European high-quality soft and hard flooring industry. In 2024 the concept was expanded in every dimension. The event was open from 13 until 16 May and European manufacturers could come to The Hub to exhibit their products. A total of 38 international participants chose to take part with a stand here at Kortrijk Xpo. The inspiring Trend Talks were another new addition this year. On Monday 13 May, it was a full house for Judith Van Vliet's seminar Do you speak color?. A very accessible session that provided direct inspiration for everyone active in the interiors sector, with valuable and actionable takeaways. The Design Language masterclass by Christine Boland was also received with great enthusiasm. It was easy for visitors to find their way from the showrooms to The Hub thanks to the free shuttle service. So everyone was able to meet exactly the producers on their wish list. The responses at the event were very positive. The successful third edition of Flanders Flooring Days definitely left visitors with a taste for more. So the fair will be taking place again in 2025, this time from 2 to 5 June. Put the date in your diary now.

Starting from this basic assumption, we want to look at central aspects of customer engagement.

It fullfills all requirements and is fully recyclable to new raw materials for carpets. Also the concept of separating the layers after use for a wide range of applications could be proven. These concepts also work for carpet tiles without any limitations for use or life span. The novel concepts result in a significant reduction of the Global warming potential (GWP) and are a important starting point for the green transition of the industry.

The pilot plant demonstrated both the feasibility of recovering more than 90% of the wood fibers, depending on the HDF quality, and, the use of these recycled fibers in the production of a new HDF/MDF with no quality losses. The optimization of the recycling process has facilitated the upscaling investment that is being implemented and will be ready for production by Q4 2025. The business case is strong with energy savings compared to virgin wood fibers but the challenge remains the post consumer waste collection and sorting. Meet Sbastien Combey Sbastien COMBEY has spent most of the last 27 years in Laminate Flooring Industry in France, Sweden and Belgium. Since 2021, as Global Technical Services Manager at Unilin BV flooring division it became obvious to work on Circular Laminate within CiSuFlo project. The central position between R&D, Production and Sales facilitates the communication and the implementation of best practices internally and externally. Sbastien is also active in EPLF Technical Committee and in standardization working groups to bring circularity at the next level by discussing with counterparts among other flooring manufacturers.

This mat is made from ECONYL and features HydroTX technology. Pebbles design is inspired by nature. The coarse, textured material has a random pattern derived from the surface of pebbles. The mix of hard and soft yarns creates a subtle texture with a clear purpose: to conceal dirt. The four colour options are based on natural minerals: three shades of grey  Basalt , Granite , and Quartz  and a warm beige variant: Sandstone . Pebble is an absorbent entrance mat that quickly takes up moisture and hides dirt from view. It is made from regenerated ECONYL yarn, with an optionally available PVC-free Pura Backing . Thanks to HydroTX , Pebble begins absorbing moisture from the very first step. It falls within use class 32 and meets fire classification Cfl-s1 . Pebble is ideal for entrances where aesthetics and functionality go hand in hand  such as schools, offices, or public spaces with high footfall. Its natural colours, concealing qualities, and proven performance make Pebble a practical choice for busy entrance areas. icons8-email Created with Sketch. Contact us!

Add to my exhibitors icons8-email Created with Sketch. Contact us! Swiss company Fabromont AG is the manufacturer of the first-rate and unique textile floor covering Kugelgarn  , which has been successful in many areas of commercial building over the past decades. Kugelgarn  is characterised by exceptional design and high quality and can be seamlessly integrated into any architectural concept. Thanks to freedom of direction and cut resistance, the design possibilities are endless and can be implemented individually, creating a seamless look. This is how Kugelgarn  creates security and ambience. The manufacturing technique of Kugelgarn  is special: instead of being spun into one-dimensional yarns (threads) as is the case with carpets, the fibres are spun into spherical three-dimensional yarns. The fibre balls are then brought into the surface and consolidated into a highly durable textile covering. Kugelgarn  is available as broadloom as well as modular goods and tiles. The modules are produced without a heavy backing and are available in various formats. The floor covering is used particularly frequently in the office and education sector (schools, universities) - for example in the European Central Bank in Frankfurt/Germany or the Maison du Savoir in Esch-sur-Alzette. Thanks to their sound-absorbing properties, the floor coverings contribute to a positive working atmosphere, especially in open-space offices. Other areas of application are retirement homes and cultural venues. As a founding member of bu (Swiss Association for Sustainable Business), which was established in 1989, Fabromont committed itself to the topic of sustainability at a very early stage and bears the label Swiss Made - resource-saving production takes place directly at the Schmitten (FR) site in Switzerland and all raw materials are sourced exclusively from the European economic area. All Kugelgarn  products also have TV PROFICERT and GuT certification as well as Ecological Product Declarations (EPDs) and contribute to the fulfilment of DGNB and LEED criteria. Kugelgarn  by Fabromont combines aesthetics, economy and sustainability.

How It Started Rezas story is a tale about 30 years of experience finding hidden treasures around the world and making sure that these gems live on in our homes for years to come. Rezas Oriental & Modern Rugs was founded in 1991 under modest conditions: \"A boxroom as a warehouse, a rented van and Reza at the wheel. However, things went fast: On the second customer visit I got a great order  it was on the amount of 7.516,00  that was what I expected to sell the whole month! Just a few years later, we got our breakthrough and since then we have only been moving forward. The department store Magasin, was let down by their supplier. In less than 24 hours, we procured rugs of such high quality that a co-operation with Magasin and other of Europes largest department stores was set.\" (Reza Rejaye  Founder) Rezas Today Over the last 30 years, we have become Northern Europes largest importer of rugs. The market has changed a lot and so has the consumers buying behavior. We now have an exclusive and attractive assortment of high-quality modern rugs together with our oriental collections. We proudly stand by the quality of our products. Each of our rugs starts its life as wool or viscose that is spun into rich, colorful yarns used by the expert rug knotters. Then the beautiful yarns are knotted into stunning rugs of high quality. Our rugs are testimonies of lived lives, old traditions, still as relevant as they were thousands of years ago, respect for our surroundings and the use of material used to become a Rezas rug. In cooperation with our customers, both big chains, wholesalers as well as small specialist shops, we do our best to improve. Trust and quality are our keywords. Trust in our suppliers and competent employees. High quality and a convincing sense for market trends are the main reasons why we are a preferred partner. We are looking forward to adding new chapters to our history in cooperation with customers, suppliers and employees all over the world. Our Showroom At our showroom in Odense, we always have between 50,000 and 100,000 rugs to choose from. As a professional customer, you are always welcome to visit us and choose your own unique rugs. Besides a large range of oriental rugs, we also have a large attractive collection of modern rugs, both hand-knotted and hand-woven. Rugs which are designed to fit trends and colors of the day, with emphasis on the Scandinavian style.

Add to my exhibitors icons8-email Created with Sketch. Contact us! Lamett, floors designed for life Lamett is a producer and distributor of wooden floors and Parquetvinyl. In less than 15 years the company has grown into one of the most important players in the flooring sector in Europe and far beyond. Quality and service are two pillars that make Lamett a reliable partner. Parquet is a very noble and durable product with an unsurpassed appearance; a real mood enhancer in your interior. From the choice of collection to the maintenance of your wooden floor, with Lamett you have a real partner in the house. Rustic or modern floors, oil or lacquer, a click system or a classic tongue and groove,... they have it all. At the end of 2017, Lamett launched Parquetvinyl, a luxury vinyl floor (spc floor) based on limestone that combines the splendour of wood with the convenience of vinyl. Hardly distinguishable from a real wooden floor in terms of appearance, Parquetvinyl is extremely versatile. This floor is waterproof and therefore suitable for every room, including kitchens and bathrooms. Moreover, thanks to its click system it can be easily installed on top of most existing hard floors and this with only basic tools. A new product range will be presented during Flanders Flooring Days.

Add to my exhibitors icons8-email Created with Sketch. Contact us! Tapibel is a passionate carpet producer based in Pelt (Belgium). We produce carpet for the residential market, the contract market and the event sector among others. You have certainly come to the right place for rugs, wall-to-wall carpet and carpet tiles, both tufted and needle felt. Everything starts with the yarn and the fibres. Every carpet and every floor covering starts as a bobbin of basic yarn, millions of yarns that are processed into one whole. The people behind Tapibel know the world of carpet like the back of their hand. We have been true carpet masters for over fifty years, producing both tufted and needle felt carpet. We have been passing on the knowledge of carpet production from generation to generation since 1970. You can see, hear and feel our tradition: in the authentic factory, in the innovative products, but above all, in the people behind Tapibel. What is our common thread? Respect. Respect for each other, our products, the machines and of course, our customer. The relationships we establish with customers and employees are always sustainable, open and honest. We work with machines to manufacture our rugs, carpets and carpet tiles, but humanity is the central theme. Our employees man the machines, fill them, adjust them and check the carpets carefully. Its all in the details. Quality and service are key, loose ends (and loose threads) dont stand a chance. Most of our tufted carpets are intended for the contract market for use in offices, hotels and public buildings. Our needle felt carpet is in demand in the event sector.

Add to my exhibitors icons8-email Created with Sketch. Contact us! CISUFLO, standing for Circular Sustainable flooring, is a European funded project aiming at creating a systemic framework for circular and sustainable flooring (carpets, vinyl and laminates) and minimise the overall environmental impact of the sector. CISUFLO provides systemic innovation at technical, informational and socio-economic level and has run six pilot projects to demonstrate their feasibility and value (manufacturing of future flooring, sorting, separation, recycling of laminate, vinyl and textile flooring). The goal is to realise the circular economy through innovation: by producing floor coverings that are easier to remove and recycle, and are containing recycled content. An extended product information system enables sorting, and allows to retrieve sustainability and technical information by all stakeholders.

Fabromont is now releasing the most sustainable Kugelgarn  ever with the new Reval  collection with textile content made from 100% ECONYL  yarn in the wear layer and recycled polyester in the backing. ECONYL  is regenerated nylon made entirely from polyamide waste. In the development of Kugelgarn Reval  , special attention was paid to transferring the unique Kugelgarn  technology to the new material ECONYL  and to meeting the highest quality demands on Kugelgarn  in this most sustainable variant as well. The result is a diverse collection that combines sustainability and quality and thus protects the environment without sacrificing the usual Kugelgarn  advantages. This also convinced the jury of the Red Dot Award 2024, which honoured Kugelgarn Reval  as a winner in the Product Design category. Document View catalog icons8-email Created with Sketch. Contact us!

Add to my exhibitors icons8-email Created with Sketch. Contact us! With the launch of the new EFC25+ collection at the beginning of this year, EGGER presents a modern and contemporary flooring collection that impresses with attractive decors and innovative products. With a wide variety of designs, plank formats and surfaces, the six different product lines meet a wide variety of needs and requirements. Another innovative product development is waiting to be discovered: with EGGER DecoWall wall cladding, you can design walls simply and stylishly. The wooden panels combine the stability and load-bearing capacity of a classic OSB board with a decorative surface that immediately impresses  without sanding, painting or wallpapering! The family company, which has been in existence since 1961, is a leading international wood-based material manufacturer with over 11,000 employees and 22 production sites worldwide. EGGER is a full-range supplier for furniture and interior design, for structural wood construction and for wood-based flooring, making it a reliable partner for the furniture industry, the wood and flooring trade and DIY stores. The aspect of sustainable management is always at the heart of EGGER: Already today 65% of the wood used comes from recycling or by-products. At the end of their long service life, EGGER products are largely recyclable and can be reintroduced into the cycle. With this and many other measures, the family company is constantly working on its goal of making \"more out of the valuable resource wood\" and thus enabling sustainable living and working.

While many waterproof skirting boards are made of plastic, we focus on sustainability and natural materials. The base material is a special HDF that guarantees excellent water resistance. In addition, our tried-and-tested PUR bonding ensures that the decor does not detach from the skirting when it comes into contact with water - for a permanently flawless surface and high durability. Whether in the living area or in damp rooms such as bathrooms or kitchens - HydroLignum is the ideal solution. In addition to its water resistance, the skirting board impresses with its high durability in everyday use and the usual Pedross decor variety.

Evolved from the rich textile heritage in Flanders, Creatuft has been for decades a major producer of natural floor coverings, such as sisal and wool. We realised early on that using synthetic materials is not a sustainable option. So whilst focusing on durability, Creatuft manufactures high-end and timeless natural carpets. We guarantee excellent craftmanship, starting from the raw fibres to the finished carpet. One of the main pillars to sustain this strategy is our vertically integrated family structure. This is unique in our sector, and together with our 150 dedicated employees, we feel proud of that.

One of the standout features of these polyester rugs is the relief effect, which adds a three-dimensional appearance to the designs. The abstract patterns range from bold geometric shapes to more fluid, organic motifs. What sets these polyester rugs apart is their resemblance to the luxurious look of wool and silk.

The innovative, environmentally friendly flooring category not only impresses with its durability, but also with its versatility. Thanks to usage class 33 and abrasion class 5, UBERWOOD can withstand even the heaviest loads. In addition, the patented megaloc-aqua-protect quick installation system protects the floor from water penetration for up to a week. The integrated 2 mm thick high-tech impact sound insulation ensures pleasant room acoustics and makes the floor particularly quiet. In addition to its impressive functionality, UBERWOOD also impresses with its natural look. Inspired by a wide variety of wood species, grains and textures, our designers have created authentic designs that perfectly reflect the character of real wood and stone. Special attention is also paid to the feel: with three newly developed, harmonised surface textures, UBERWOOD conveys a particularly realistic feeling of living.
