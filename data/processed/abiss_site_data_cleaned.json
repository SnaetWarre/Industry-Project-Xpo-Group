Back then, it was a small summit, featuring 32 technology partners, 260 participants and 14 highly regarded speakers covering topics such as industrial digitalisation, industry 4.0 and IoT. This very successful experience resulted in an annual growth in the number of visitors and technology partners present at the event. All this with a close monitoring of the content: apps, software and solutions for smart and connected factories. In 2024, ABISS welcomed no less than 1303 physical and digital visitors. ABISS has therefore clearly become the place to be for OT and IT teams in the Benelux who are looking for solutions for the digital processes implemented within their organisation. The concept of a one-day event where you can immediately test the combined knowledge of 14 experts in IoT and factories of the future under one roof remains unchanged. The spectrum of knowledge of the experts, as well as the range of technologies and partners, are organised around three main themes, namely Industry of Things, Intelligence of Things and Security of Things. The tone for the next and 9th edition of ABISS has already been set! Today, ABISS has grown into a must-visit Benelux event that combines a summit, a networking platform and a trade fair for C-levels and department managers (OT), supported by their colleagues from IT, who are looking for smart and secure solutions for tomorrow's connected and integrated factories!

This can be live data from an industrial automated system, a smart meter, an SQL Server database, historical data from an Excel file or via web services. A large number of standard interfaces are available for this. STORE High Performance database At the heart of SkySpark is the high-performance Folio database, specially developed for IoT data. The Folio database combines the speed of an Industrial Historian with the capabilities of a relational database. As a result, data is heterogeneously organised into unified models of buildings with devices, systems and sensors. By using advanced compression techniques, only a fraction of shear space is required for millions of time series records compared to other techniques. Live sensor data is stored in milliseconds. This drastically reduces server hardware requirements. ORGANIZE Give your data Meaning SkySpark uses the industry-standard Project Haystack for semantic tagging of data. With the right tag coding, analysing data becomes easy and fast. Patterns are automatically interpreted this way, resulting in a clear overview of anomalies, errors and trends. With this, systems become more efficient and are applied correctly. ANALYZE Turn Data into Actionable Intelligence Getting access to data is just the first step. The challenge of big data is dealing with it efficiently. Our solution is Axon: a Rule Based Engine, which automatically runs rules and algorithms over the data to generate Sparks (= things that matter). A Spark visually indicates what goes wrong in terms of duration, time, frequency, cause, solution and possibly cost impact. This way, you only see what is wrong and don't have to dig through the endless mountain of data. SkySpark automatically generates the screens, notifications and reports to do what is necessary. Analytic Function Library SkySpark comes standard with more than 500 built-in analytical functions. You can add your own new functions to this library for specific situations. In addition, SkySpark has a lively community, eager to share knowledge. VISUALIZE Apps to help you Find What Matters SkySpark comes with a comprehensive set of applications to visualise data and analytics. These intuitive views are displayed in all standard HTML5-based web browsers. SkySpark data can be exported to third-party applications via API.

Two typical application domains are (1) virtual engineering where a 3D model is used to dimension and virtually commission a production process; and (2) virtual user experience where employees can easily interact with a generated 3D environment that plays out realistic production situations related to their job content in function of user research and training . Many challenges still exist to create and maintain such applications. Within this presentation, we will take a closer look at how system integrators, machine builders and manufacturing companies can best approach such projects. Besides the potential of each separately, the added value lies mainly in the continuous synergy between the two domains, namely virtual engineering  experience, or VEX for short.

In this session, I will share our story, in which we shaped our strategy from our mission as a family-owned company. QRM proved crucial for our growth without much hierarchy and with the necessary flexibility in a growing company. From idea to plan, from plan to implementation, and of course the results. We will discuss the challenges we've encountered and are still experiencing. But we have more ambition, we re just at the beginning. With our digital tools, we can create much more value.

Johan Sinaeve, DEWILDE ENGINEERING Thursday 03 October 2024 icons8-watch Created with Sketch. 10:35-11:05 Learn Hub 1 - Industry Of Things Many technologies are hyped, and this is very much the case for the Digital Twin concept. Our DT journey started more than six years ago and, as a no-nonsense West-Flemish machine builder, we were considerably skeptical about the added value it could mean for us, but especially for custom-made machine building. Now we are several years and DT projects further along in our journey and would have liked to give our evolved opinion on the practical deployment of Digital Twins , pros and cons.

Why ABISS? 5 GOOD REASONS WHY YOUR POTENTIAL CLIENTS ARE BOUND TO VISIT ABISS ... OR WHY YOU SHOULD BE AN EXHIBITOR Digitalisation and automation is an ongoing process of learning, orientation, testing, adjusting and improvement. An ideal solution for this is a trade show/congress where technology providers help you make the right decisions thanks to their knowledge , combined with personal discussions. The digitalisation of a production company is among the most complex digitalisation tasks . The number of business processes in a production company is indeed much larger than in a retail or services model. Between engineering and the actual delivery/distribution of the product, there are many other processes such as planning, maintenance, prototyping, quality control, factory layout, supply chain, HR, ordering ABISS is therefore the place to be for both full and partial integration of digitalisation software. Digitalisation projects are complex, expensive and time-consuming and have a profound impact on the business model. Companies that are taking their first steps, or which are already at a more advanced stage, need reliable partners for technology, counselling, implementation, training and support. All the more reason to make contacts face to face with companies that can convince the visitor that they have this expertise in-house and therefore deserve the customers trust. Digitalisation is booming. The number of providers of software, apps and services is increasing exponentially. For the teams concerned in the target audience, it is becoming increasingly difficult to decide and make the right choices . ABISS will provide visitors with a clear overview of the current situation that they will not find on any other trade show platform.

Contact us From customer service, sales and even founders we often hear they need to support their technicians more, because... sometimes the quality of the installation is insufficient, which impacts the brand most of the time we're in a reactive mode , and only fix things while the client is already frustrated too often it goes wrong when ordering new spare parts , which impacts sales they lose a lot of time installing and configuring the device That's why we build digital applications and connect humans with machines to create business value. Our solution for eg. Daikin Team innovation at Daikin revamped their installer application with our help and it is experiencing a growth of 75% active users without additional support calls and a reduction of ~12% installation time thanks to improved ease of use. We have done technical research, workshops, product design, product development and more for clients such as Locinox, Lightstream, Novy, Specter,... Why Aaltra  We know I(O)T Connecting things to the cloud is what we love, Aaltra has been pioneering the Internet of Things (IoT) and Operational Technology since 2007  Design & Tech in core Design is the most universal language.

The complexity, the expertise, the internal collaboration, the budgets and the impact of the decision on functioning, productivity, competitiveness, assets and personnel are so important that a constant sharpening of knowledge, new applications and consultation have become an ongoing commitment for the company. The fact is that commitment and knowledge should not be limited to management (general policy); the shop floor should be involved too. Every business unit has its own needs and criteria with respect to feasibility and performance. Therefore, every digitalisation step must fit a perfectly orchestrated whole. For what sort of companies ? Every production company, industrial or not, belongs to this target audience. Every possible production company, regardless of whether we are talking about discrete or process industry, may be considered (manufacturing, chemical, pharma, mechanical engineering, food, agribusiness, metal, plastics, wood, textile, etc.) What is the target audience ? ABISS specifically targets the following profiles of visitors : C-levels, owners and general management of SMEs and large companies Managers and prescribers from specific business processes (production, maintenance, procurement, engineering, planning, R&D, quality, SCM, warehousing, safety, IT, HR) Heads of IT, cybersecurity MEDIA PARTNERS CONTENT PARTNERS BECOME A PARTNER CONTACT US PROGRAMME MEDIA | PRESS INDUSTRIALFAIRS Opening dates & hours Thursday 3 October 2024 - 9.00 - 17.00 hrs Location Kortrijk Xpo Doorniksesteenweg 216 8500 Kortrijk (Belgium) X Facebook LinkedIn YouTube 2025, Industrialfairs Privacy Policy - Coockiestatement - General terms & conditions - View cookies Necessary cookies (necessary for the correct functioning of the website) Social media cookies (used by Facebook, YouTube, ...)

Today, manufacturers are trying to cope with the high demand of customer market initiatives requiring production facilities to adapt immediately. This leads to new technologies and constantly changing production requirements to cope with the market demands. The strategy of using a dedicated software product (technology) is at risk due to inflexibility and reaction time to market changes. This is one of the main reasons why we at Contec developed our production management solution (CPMS). CPMS is a light weight framework fully compatible with industrial standards allowing us to modify production processes immediately, connect any equipment or legacy system and integrate new technologies on the spot. We also see it as a commitment within our own company to invest in standards that allow us to serve our customers in the best way possible. CPMS is integrated within our standard integration services to deliver a high quality and standardised solution to our customers. Document View catalog icons8-email Created with Sketch.
