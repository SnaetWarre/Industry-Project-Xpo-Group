People who, just like us, believe in quality, have an eye for detail and value a shop that says something about them. The Artisan trade fair is the perfect opportunity to meet, inspire each other and show how our Integral shop interiors can make a difference, offering practical, attractive solutions that are, above all, tailored to the needs of modern businesses. Jozefien De Baere, Marketing Manager - INTEGRAL INTERIEUR www.integral-interieur.be Artisan provides a unique opportunity to showcase new products and to connect with customers who would be difficult to reach without this trade fair. The relaxed atmosphere of the event allows us to talk business and share ideas in an informal way. The pleasant setting encourages open conversations, leading to valuable insights and promoting new collaborations. Patrick Van Den Broucke, CEO - VAN DEN BROUCKE BAKKERIJMACHINES www.vandenbrouckebakkerijmachines.be We will be exhibiting at Artisan in Kortrijk for the first time and cannot wait to share our Flora Tea tea flowers with all the visitors to this trade fair! We have heard great things about this event and look forward to surprising everyone with the unique experience provided by our flowering tea. See you soon! Joyce Veldman, CEO - FLORA TEA EUROPE www.floratea.nl Artisan is the go-to place where Belgian craftsmanship and expertise come together. For Zeeuwsche Zoute, it will be a fantastic opportunity to introduce our Dutch sea salt, which is harvested using traditional methods in the Scheldt Delta Geopark (which has recently been recognised as a Global Geopark by UNESCO), to our southern neighbours. We bring the authentic taste of the Eastern Scheldt to specialist retailers and gourmets with the utmost respect for tradition and sustainability. Christian Clerx, Owner - ZEEUWSCHE ZOUTE www.zeeuwschezoute.nl We at JOKA are very much looking forward to participating in Artisan 2025! The new name of this trade fair and the fresh impetus it provides bring great opportunities to our sector every time it is held. Events such as this always provide real added value to both our existing and new customers. It is the perfect opportunity to connect with our target group, forge valuable relationships and present our latest delicacies. This allows us to continue to strengthen our unique and distinctive position in the cold meats and delicatessen market. Mathias Verbeke, Sales Manager - JOKA www.jokajoka.com Artisan is the go-to place for suppliers wishing to showcase themselves to the bakery sector. Artisan is a trade fair where people in the sector can find everything they are looking for in a pleasant atmosphere. Kalmeijer has been exhibiting at this fair for years with a fully functioning bakery where bakers can feel, smell and taste quality artisan products! The 2023 event was a huge success for us, and we will come back in 2025 to continue to support the Belgian bakery sector. Sander Bon, Sales Manager - KALMEIJER www.kalmeijer.com We set the bar high for our quality meat, which leads us to do the same when choosing which trade fairs to participate in. As loyal participants in Tavola and Meat Expo, we fully support Artisan's new concept. After all, practicing your craft with passion and expertise and providing consumers with top-quality products is what matters most, right? That is why I am so proud to be one of the ambassadors of the event. Artisan and Duroc d'Olives are united in the fact that we both place authentic Belgian craftsmanship above all else. I am pretty confident that this first endeavour will be a hit! Bndicte Dobbels, Owner - DUROC DOLIVES www.durocdolives.com Artisan is a fantastic trade fair that attracts lots of specialist retailers. It is a great opportunity to talk to people and forge links between cheese shops and our distributors. Mark Eversteijn, International Account Manager - TREUR KAAS www.treurkaas.nl K&F De Pauw participates in Artisan because it is the go-to place where professionals from the food sector can meet and inspire each other. The trade fair gives us the opportunity to meet both existing customers as well as new, promising partners. The previous event allowed us to establish many valuable contacts and discover a wide range of premium products and trends that align perfectly with our market. Broodway/Meat Expo 2023 was characterised by a vibrant atmosphere, with a strong focus on sustainability and craftsmanship. We appreciated the diversity of exhibitors, from big names to emerging players in the market. We are therefore extremely excited about Artisan 2025 and are curious to see how this rebranding will help the event rise to an even higher level. Artisan certainly looks set to become a leading light in the B2B food world! Tina De Pauw, Operational Manager - K&F DE PAUW www.knfdepauw.be The fair is a tremendous success for us every time, thanks to the perfectly balanced target group, which includes both large chains and small retailers. Each event enables us to attract new customers and expand our network. Plus, the organisation is always flawless, which makes us very happy. Alix Gellynck, Key Account Manager - GRANO LADIES www.xavies.be Zeelandia's participation in Artisan provides us with the opportunity to network with customers and showcase the latest trends and products, directly contributing to our growth and innovation. This trade fair is a valuable source of inspiration and knowledge exchange for us. Kris Dierckx, Marketing Director Befralux - ZEELANDIA www.zeelandia.be Since the start of Broodway, I haven't missed a single edition. First with Leman Cake Decorations and later on with Mallows. Each time this was THE place to be for our company to make new contacts. Artisan is a justified evolution that will honour our craft. For Mallows, Artisan is an ideal platform because of the mix of customers that will pass by. Both the bakery and the food specialty store are the audience we address. Artisan and Mallows.... A perfect match! Didier Leman, Manager - MALLOWS www.mallows.be For us, Artisan is the fair where we always make valuable and pleasant contacts with visitors who are looking for quality products. The professional, stylish decoration of the fair creates a pleasant and inspiring working environment. We are therefore looking forward with great enthusiasm to the next edition where everyone is welcome to taste our delicious croquettes and discuss possible collaborations. Maureen, AMUSE CROQUE-team www.amusecroque.be The world of butchery is rapidly changing. It is therefore crucial for our artisan butchers to keep up with the latest developments in the field. ARTISAN provides them with the fantastic opportunity to update their knowledge and skills within a short period of time. Furthermore, every professional will find everything they need at ARTISAN to successfully run their business with a modern approach. Needless to say, we will also be organising our renowned professional competitions in 2025, giving our artisan butchers the opportunity to have their top-quality products tasted and judged by a panel of professionals. The showcased products will undoubtedly be a bonus for both participants and visitors. ARTISAN will have something special for everyone. We look forward to seeing you all on our stand. See you there! Ivan Claeys, Chairman - BELGIAN ASSOCIATION OF BUTCHERS AND CATERERS www.bb-bb.be Passion, innovation and artisan food manufacturing will be a must in the future for bakers to make a difference. Artisan in Kortrijk Xpo will be a wonderful place to source new ideas. It will be a truly inspiring event for all food artisans. Hendrik Rommelaere, Chairman of BAKMEESTERS WEST-VLAANDEREN & Co-chairman ARTISAN www.bakmeesters.be The butchery world is evolving rapidly, which is why we will be tackling the subject of craftsmanship with great enthusiasm at the next Artisan event. We would like to invite everyone to join us at this top-class 2025 event.

Add to my exhibitors icons8-email Created with Sketch. Albertus Schulp started out as a tenant farmer in 1861 on one hectare of land in Breukelen along the river Vecht. Five generations of Schulp grew up as fruit growers, on the same land and along the same river. In 1995, Albert Schulp decided to focus on making juice in addition to growing fruit. A good choice, because since that year Schulp has been making the pure and naturally cloudy juice that you know from us. As a family, we have traditionally been based in the Vecht region, part of the Groene Hart. We are well aware of all the beauty that the Dutch countryside has to offer and we naturally take good care of it. This stewardship is reflected in the conscious choices we make, such as generating our own green energy and using it responsibly. In addition, we bring the residual product of squeezed fruit to our neighbouring farmers as feed for their cattle. The remaining waste is carefully separated, which means that we have virtually no residual waste. We prefer to use Dutch fruit, often from fruit growers in the region. For our double juices, we also use Dutch fruit as much as possible, such as apples, pears, strawberries and blueberries. The entire process from pressing to bottling takes place in-house. In this way, we limit our food miles and support the fruit growing sector in our own country.
