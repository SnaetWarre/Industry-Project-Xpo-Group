7. How to Deploy
Build and push your automation Docker image:

docker build -t <youracr>.azurecr.io/xpo-automation:latest .
docker push <youracr>.azurecr.io/xpo-automation:latest

Create an Azure Container App Job:
Use the image you just pushed.

Set the schedule (e.g., every Saturday at 2 AM).
Set environment variables as above.
Monitor logs and results in Azure Portal.

8. Security Notes
Never commit real secrets to git.
Use Azure environment variables for all secrets in production.
Use a dedicated service account for automation (secretuploader).
